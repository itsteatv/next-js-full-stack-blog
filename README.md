- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`**: The URL of your Supabase project.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`**: The public anonymous key for accessing Supabase services.

### Database (Prisma)

Add this variable in a `.env.local` file in the root directory to specify the local SQLite database URL:

### Email Service (Resend)

For email notifications and communication, provide the Resend API key:

- **`RESEND_API_KEY`**: API key to authenticate and authorize the email-sending service.
